### **by the way...**

This project is for only use for us (Of course you can use).

I saw a person who plays Jackpost Slotmachine Simulation at School.

It was very Cool and Nice game to studens (I am in middle school)

But this game is also very bored.

It was only fun when the jackpot hits.

So, i decided to make this extended version.

That's why this project was created.

Having fun playing at school :)
